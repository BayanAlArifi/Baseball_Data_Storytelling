## Introduction

An explanatory data visualization using Tableau is done to tell a story and highlights trends/patterns in a baseball players dataset. The project touches on the overarching attitudes and beliefs important to effective data visualization, such as:
* visualization is a dialog
* showcasing and sharing visualizations with others
* visualization is a fluid process that typically requires multiple iterations of improvements

The end-to-end process of creating effective data visualizations and highlighting important information from data that may otherwise be hidden or hard to uncover is carried out. These include the following:
* Choosing th optimal visual elements to encode data and critically assess the effectiveness of a visualization
* Communicating a story or finding to the appropriate audience using interactive visualizations
* Underging the iterative process of creating a visualization, and build interactive visualizations with Tableau

* weight (in pounds)
* batting average

## Summary
* Determine the relationship between a baseball player's weight and home runs.
