    "Different visualization techniques were used to communicate insights on the performanc of the baseball players.

    "All charts were combined in one interactive bar chart, where the focus was on the top players with hom run hits only. The chart shows the player's name, handedness, and home runs. Only these dimentions are fixed. The rest of the dimentions weight, height and batting average are dynamically shown when chosen in order to see how each of these metrics relate to high home run hits. In the legend, there are interface elements to help interact with the chart dynamically. Moreover, there's a choice of metric to show as a bullet-point list, and a summary of the home runs dimention and the metric. The metric bars are color-coded based on the metric choice. Hovering over each bar shows the the player's name, handedness, home runs, and the chosen metric; batting average, weight, and height. The average of the top performaing players for each metric is illustrated by the dashed reference line on the chart. It was found that players with weights around this average scored the most amount of home runs.\n",
